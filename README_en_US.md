## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Guide

### Database
- Modify credentials in `main.py` (line 68):
  ```python
  connection = mysql.connector.connect(
      host="localhost",
      user="root",       # Update if needed
      password="",       # Add your MySQL password
      database="air_travel_management"
  )
  ```

### UI Customization
- Change the theme in `main.py` (lines 18-19):
  ```python
  ctk.set_appearance_mode("dark")  # Options: "System", "Dark", "Light"
  ctk.set_default_color_theme("blue")  # Options: "blue", "green", "dark-blue"
  ```

### Repository Files
- `air_travel_management.sql`: Database schema.
- `main.py`: Application source code.
- `README.md`: Project documentation (this file).

### Additional Instructions
1. Ensure MySQL is running via XAMPP before executing `main.py`.
2. To reset passwords or add admins, edit the `users` table directly in phpMyAdmin.
3. The default admin password (`123`) is hashed as `240be518fabd2724ddb6f04eeb1da5967448d7e831c08c8fa822809f74c720a9`. Change it in the database for enhanced security.
